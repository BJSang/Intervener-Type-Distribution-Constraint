# Objective
To analyze and quantify the distribution of intervener types in natural language dependencies, contrasting them
with artificial language structures using the complete set of 285 SUD corpora across languages.
# Approach 
Developed a measurement method and implemented it in code to assess intervener types in Hindi and English. The code
generates random baseline trees aligning with natural language structures in nodes, crossings, and dependency metrics.
